# Arc Cosine

I'm a pure JavaScript expert developper.
I have been active since 2008.
Lately I have been a fan of Vite.
[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)+[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)+[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) is the trend in my mind.
I'm starting to like [vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) too.


[Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim), [HHKB](https://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/direct/hhkb/detail_pd-kb800bs.html), and [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) are tools I can't live without.
